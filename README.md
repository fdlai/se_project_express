# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

Project name: SE_PROJECT_EXPRESS

## Project Description

The Express project is a backend server intended to support the [WTWR Front-end React project](https://github.com/fdlai/se_project_react). It currently supports routes for the /users and /items endpoints, which correspond to 2 databases: one database stores the users, and another database stores clothing items.

## Project features

- Node.js
- Express framework
- MongoDB databases
- Modular design and routing
- Custom error class
- Error handling with appropriate http status codes and responses
- Hashed passwords
- JWT tokens
- Request authorization

## Plan on improving the project

Plans to add:

- More Routes
- More databases
- Link the server to the front-end project: se_project_react
- Security features

### Testing

Reminder: Before committing code, I should make sure I edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint currently on. For ex. 12
